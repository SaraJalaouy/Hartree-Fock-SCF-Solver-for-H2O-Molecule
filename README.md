# ðŸ’§ Hartree-Fock SCF Solver for Hâ‚‚O Molecule

This project implements a self-consistent field (SCF) solver based on the **Hartree-Fock method** for the **water molecule (Hâ‚‚O)** using **Fortran**. It computes the molecular orbitals, density matrix, Fock matrix, Hartree-Fock energy, and MP2 correlation correction from input integral data.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Computes overlap, one-electron, and two-electron integrals
- Builds and diagonalizes the Fock matrix
- Performs SCF iterations with convergence checking
- Outputs Hartree-Fock energy
- Transforms molecular orbital coefficients
- Calculates MP2 (second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset) energy correction
- Outputs in Molden format
- Computes atomic charges

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.f90 # Main program file
  â”œâ”€â”€ hfmod.f90 # Module containing supporting subroutines and functions
  â”œâ”€â”€ wasser.out # Output file in Molden format 


  ## ðŸ“¥ Input Files

The program expects precomputed integrals for the Hâ‚‚O molecule:
- Overlap matrix
- One-electron integrals
- Two-electron integrals
- Nuclear repulsion energy

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Compile the program using a Fortran compiler:

```bash
gfortran -o hfh2o main.f90 hfmod.f90 matrixmulti.f90 -L libprak.a
````
2. Run the executable
  hfh2o (program_name)


ðŸ“˜ Output
- SCF iteration and convergence information
- Final Hartree-Fock energy
- MP2 energy correction
- Molden-compatible output file
- Atomic charges
